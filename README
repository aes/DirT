LICENCE

I am quite unimpressed by the whole 'occupation of the world of ideas by
grants of arbitrary privilege by government fiat' concept. I am not going to
read a dozen free licences just to pick one. Instead, I'd like, if at all
possible, to circumnavigate the whole war: For now, it's GPLv2. If you know
what that means, good for you, enjoy.

If not, well, you can...
 * contact me to negotiate a different licence, or
 * obey whatever all the applicable laws say regardless of license, or
 * figure out what I meant, or
 * be naughty, and take the risk.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I ACCEPT ANY LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFECTS.

This software may be used for evil as well as for good. (why limit people?)
