LICENCE

I am quite unimpressed by the whole 'occupation of the world of ideas by
grants of arbitrary privilege by government fiat' concept. I am not going to
read a dozen free licences just to pick one. Instead, I'd like, if at all
possible, to circumnavigate the whole war: For now, it's GPLv2. If you know
what that means, good for you, enjoy.

If not, well, you can...
 * contact me to negotiate a different licence, or
 * obey whatever all the applicable laws say regardless of license, or
 * figure out what I meant, or
 * be naughty, and take the risk.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I ACCEPT ANY LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFECTS.

This software may be used for evil as well as for good. (none of my business.)

# (Display) Substition File

If you want some dirs to be displayed as something other than the path, you
can enter substitution patterns in a file called ~/.dirt_subs. In the subs
file patterns and replacements are listed, one per line separated by one or
more tabs:

pattern (one or more tabs) replacement

Lines that don't follow this pattern are ignored. If you need the pattern to
include tabs, you can use \t. Replacements can also include \1 or \g<foo> as
the replacements are done using the standard python re package.
