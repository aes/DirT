<h1>DirT</h1>
<p>DirT is an interactive browsing enhancement for the 'cd' shell builtin.</p>
<p>Currently, it has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory of paths visited in this shell instance. (uses environment variable)</li>
<li>Bookmarks where you can permanently remember commonly used paths.</li>
<li>Tree browser that helps alleviate the (cd, tab-tab-tab, expletive, ls)-loop</li>
<li>Dotfile hiding/unhiding</li>
<li>Homedir recognition</li>
<li>Name and path substitutions, to cope with long paths, preferred symlinked
   paths and perhaps other uses.</li>
<li>Interactive search, which does a lot for usability when branching factor is
   high.</li>
<li>Ignore patterns to be rid of common nuisances are implemented by
   substitution to the empty string. (No, it <em>is</em> intuitive... to /us/...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.x / 3.x portability. (Currently 2.6 is the tested version.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interactive search mode</h2>
<p>After you've entered IS, just type a few characters. As you type each char,
the display list is re-sorted to place the best matches in the middle and
highlights the middle. IS also shows the current string at the top of the
screen. Placing best matches in the middle halves is done so that the browse
distance to an entry is halved.</p>
<h2>(Display) Substition File</h2>
<p>If you want some dirs to be displayed as something other than the path, you
can enter substitution patterns in a file called ~/.dirt_subs. In the subs
file patterns and replacements are listed, one per line separated by one or
more tabs:</p>
<pre><code>pattern (one or more tabs) replacement
</code></pre>
<p>Lines that don't follow this pattern are ignored. If you need the pattern to
include tabs, you can use \t. Replacements can also include \1 or \g<foo>
as the replacements are done using the standard python re package.</p>
<h2>LICENCE</h2>
<p>For now, it's GPLv2. If you know what that means, good for you, enjoy.</p>
<p>If not, well, you can...</p>
<ul>
<li>contact me to negotiate a licence properly, or</li>
<li>obey whatever all the applicable laws say regardless of license, or</li>
<li>figure out what I meant, or</li>
<li>be naughty, and take the risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I ACCEPT ANY LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFECTS.</p>
<p>This software may be used for evil as well as for good. (none of my business.)</p>
